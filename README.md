Assignment:

Muhsina (Person 1) gets the chore at index idx (either 0 or 1).

Maher (Person 2) gets the other chore, which is calculated using (idx + 1) % chores.length.

The Result: Since the day index changes exactly once every 24 hours, the idx alternates between 0 and 1 every single day, which means the chores (Sweeping vs. Washing) automatically swap between me and Maher! Perfect rotation, no arguments needed! 😈

It's a tiny, fun project that gets a job done and shows off some slick CSS animations and simple, effective JavaScript logic!
